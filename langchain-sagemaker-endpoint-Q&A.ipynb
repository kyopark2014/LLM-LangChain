Mov ing back to Liverpool was great;  I felt like I was coming  home,  much to my parents ’ displeasure!    For the first week back , I worked a few days for the university in  my job as an A mbassador, showing potential new students  round while becoming reacqua inted with the campus myself.   When lectures restarted , it seemed like summer had  disappeared in a matter of minutes!   However , I was eager to get learning again and looked forward  to seminars and lectures on the books and topics I had been researching over the su mmer.   Students from older years had warned me about third year being pretty scary, so I had prepared well  and really enjoyed the first lectures from my new modules. Reconnecting with my societies was  doubly fun, being the President of Combined Honours for the year meant lots of summer  preparation for our first social – which was a big hit! Furthermore, as a member of the dance society  “bodysoc”, I got back into my dance classe s and performance preparation. \n",
